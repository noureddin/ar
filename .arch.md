- `Makefile` calls the appropriate building scripts.
- `.p` directory contains the scripts; all must be executables.
- `.t` directory contains the HTML templates.
- `etc` contains static resources.

Each article is a single directory, each containing these files:
- `.src` CommonMark files containing the source, with a few extensions (detailed below).
- `.head` contains the title of the article. (`.src` must NOT contain the title.)
- `.desc` contains the first paragraph (or so) of the article, on a single line, without any markup.
- `.tags` contains each (Arabic!) tag on a line by it own.
- `.pub` contains the UTC day of (first) publishing in YYYY-mm-dd format.
- `.upd` contains the UTC day of (last) updating in YYYY-mm-dd format.
- `.img` contains the name of the image to be rendered when shared (OpenGraph).

CommonMark Extensions:
- `::: note` containers (closed by `:::`).
- Block attributes (`{#id .cls}` before a block element like a heading).

CommonMark Postprocessing:
- `++` is translated to `&nbsp;`.
- Spans delimited by `[[` and `]]` are translated to `<span class="en">` and `</span>`.
- Dates of the format `YYYY-mm-dd` between `{{` and `}}` are changed to a `<time>` span with proper formating.
- Headers (only `h2` and `h3`) are given anchor links.
- Paragraphs containing only an image are changed to `<center>`.

Title (`.head`) must be a single line and plain text. It ONLY supports `[[`-`]]`.

All files, other than `.src` and `.tags`, must be a single line.

For ordering multiple posts in a single day,
you can append `.1` to the 2nd article's `.pub` date, and so on.
It only affects the order in the home page but never shown.
